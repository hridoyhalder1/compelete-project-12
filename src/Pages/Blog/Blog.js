                            The Four Kinds of React State to Manage
                            When we talk about state in our applications, it’s important to be clear about what types of state actually matter.There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:Local state,
                            Global state, Server state and URL state.
                            Local (UI) state – Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook.For example, local state would be needed to show or hide a modal component or to track values for a form component, such as form submission, when the form is disabled and the values of a form’s inputs.
                            Global (UI) state – Global state is data we manage across multiple components.

                            Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.

                            A common example of global state is authenticated user state. If a user is logged into our app, it is necessary to get and change their data throughout our application.
                            our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
                            the accordion-body, though the transition does limit overflow.

                            Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.

                            Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.  The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.

                            Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.

                            Unit testing is a component of test-driven development (TDD), a pragmatic methodology that takes a meticulous approach to building a product by means of continual testing and revision. This testing method is also the first level of software testing, which is performed before other testing methods such as integration testing. Unit tests are typically isolated to ensure a unit does not rely on any external code or functions. Testing can be done manually but is often automated.

                            How unit tests work
                            A unit test typically comprises of three stages: plan, cases and scripting and the unit test itself. In the first step, the unit test is prepared and reviewed. The next step is for the test cases and scripts to be made, then the code is tested.

                            Test-driven development requires that developers first write failing unit tests. Then they write code and refactor the application until the test passes. TDD typically results in an explicit and predictable code base.


                            Each test case is tested independently in an isolated environment, as to ensure a lack of dependencies in the code. The software developer should code criteria to verify each test case, and a testing framework can be used to report any failed tests. Developers should not make a test for every line of code, as this may take up too much time. Developers should then create tests focusing on code which could affect the behavior of the software being developed.

                            The choice between React vs Vue is often debated and it’s not an easy one. Vue has a vibrant and ever-growing community and has taken over popularity vs. React in many respects. React developers are still churning out lots of new components and extras, so there’s no sign that React is on the decline either.

                            Vue is generally more suited to smaller, less complex apps and is easier to learn from scratch compared to React. Vue can be easier to integrate into new or existing projects and many feel its use of HTML templates along with JSX is an advantage.

                            Overall, Vue might be the best choice if you’re a newer developer and not as familiar with advanced JavaScript concepts, while React is quite well suited for experienced programmers and developers who have worked with object-oriented JavaScript, functional JavaScript, and similar concepts.
